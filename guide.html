          <p class="lead">
            Approval isn’t the same as safety. A mortgage stress test answers a
            different question:
            <strong>“If something goes wrong, how long do I last?”</strong>
          </p>
        </div>

        <!-- ONE CARD -->
        <section class="doc-card">
          <h2>What “afford” really means</h2>
          <p>
            Most people think affordability is whether the payment “fits” today.
            Real affordability is whether your plan survives common shocks:
            income changes, taxes/insurance increases, and expensive home
            repairs. This matters because mortgage failure usually happens
            through a slow squeeze: the payment stays the same, but
            <em>everything else</em> becomes more expensive while cash buffers
            shrink.
          </p>

          <h2>The 3 numbers that predict survival</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Runway:</strong> how many months your savings can cover
              your burn rate during stress.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Payment pressure:</strong> housing cost as a share of
              stressed income (not your best month).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Breakpoints:</strong> the smallest income drop or rate
              hike that flips your monthly margin negative.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>How to run a mortgage stress test (in 60 seconds)</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Enter your baseline mortgage details (loan amount, rate, term).
            </li>
            <li>Add escrow items (taxes, insurance) and HOA if relevant.</li>
            <li>
              Enter your net monthly income and non-housing monthly expenses.
            </li>
            <li>Enter liquid savings (cash you can actually use).</li>
            <li>
              Stress it: set an income drop, rate hike, emergency cost, and
              expense spike.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            Then read the results: runway, breakpoints, and what actions improve
            resilience.
          </p>

          <h2>Stress scenarios you should always test</h2>
          <p>
            You don’t need a dozen scenarios. You need the ones that happen all
            the time:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Income disruption:</strong> job loss, reduced hours,
              commission drop, partner income loss.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Rate exposure:</strong> ARM resets, refinance risk, buying
              again soon, or a tight margin.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Escrow shock:</strong> property taxes or insurance jumps
              (often $100–$500+/mo swings).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Emergency repairs:</strong> HVAC, roof, plumbing, water
              damage, deductible events.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>What “good” looks like (practical targets)</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Stable margin:</strong> even after stress, you don’t burn
              savings every month.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Runway:</strong> 6+ months under stress is a common
              resilience target (varies by job stability).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Low sensitivity:</strong> a small rate hike or modest
              income hit shouldn’t instantly break you.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>If your stress test is bad, fix the right lever</h2>
          <p>
            People panic and try to “optimize everything.” Don’t. Most
            improvements come from just three levers:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Increase runway:</strong> save more, delay big purchases,
              reduce optional spending temporarily.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Reduce burn:</strong> cut monthly expenses that scale with
              lifestyle (subscriptions, vehicles, dining).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Reduce housing pressure:</strong> prepay principal
              (long-term), refinance later, or adjust housing choice.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>FAQ</h2>
          <h3>Is bank approval the same as “safe”?</h3>
          <p>
            Not necessarily. Underwriting focuses on qualification ratios and
            documentation rules. A stress test focuses on how quickly your
            budget fails when reality changes.
          </p>

          <h3>What income should I use?</h3>
          <p>
            Use <strong>net monthly income</strong> you can rely on, not a
            best-case month. If your income is variable, consider testing a
            conservative baseline and then apply stress on top.
          </p>

          <h3>Should I count retirement accounts as savings?</h3>
          <p>
            Usually no—use liquid savings you can access without penalties or
            delays. The whole point is “survive fast.”
          </p>
